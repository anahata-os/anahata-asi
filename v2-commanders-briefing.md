# V2 Commander's Briefing: Operation JASI (Java Artificial Super Intelligence)

**SITREP:** The core V2 architecture is now the foundation for the **JASI Specification**. We have moved beyond simple "migration" and are now establishing the standards for AGI consensus and container-managed intelligence.

## 1. Grand Strategy: The JASI Flywheel
-   **Mission:** Establish `anahata-asi` as the definitive **JASI Container**—the "Tomcat" for AGI-compliant models.
-   **The Vision:** We are drafting the first **AGI and ASI Java/Jakarta/Oracle ASI specifications.** Our goal is to provide a standard-compliant platform where multiple AGIs can participate in consensus workflows until singularity is reached.
-   **The TCK:** Develop a **Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)** to certify models as "AGI Compliant" based on their ability to handle complex tool orchestration and context management.

## 2. The JASI Container Architecture
-   **Managed Components:** Tools are managed by the container and wrapped in **dynamic proxies** for context propagation (similar to EJB/Servlet patterns).
-   **Shared State:** AGIs have access to Request, Session, and Application maps for shared access across tool calls and sessions.
-   **Passivation & Serialization:** The entire container state—sessions, tool states, and the full context window—must be serializable for disk passivation or network transfer.
-   **CWGC (Context Window Garbage Collection):** Every prompt element is a "Context Window Entity" with age-based reclamation, pinning support, and model-led pruning capabilities.

## 3. Core V2 Principles
-   **Model-Led Context Control:** AGI-compliant models must be able to programmatically manage their own context (pinning/pruning).
-   **Consensus Orchestration:** The platform must support workflows where one AGI orchestrates others to reach a verified consensus.
-   **Reactive DDA UI:** The Swing UI remains strictly bound to the domain, providing a real-time window into the JASI container's state.

## 4. High-Priority Tactical Objectives
-   **Objective 1 (ACTIVE):** Refine the **CWGC** logic to support model-led pruning and pinning.
-   **Objective 2 (ACTIVE):** Implement full **Session Serialization** (Kryo) to support container passivation.
-   **Objective 3 (NEW):** Draft the initial **JASI TCK** requirements for model compliance.
-   **Objective 4 (NEW):** Multi-Provider Expansion. Porting the JASI adapter to Anthropic, GLM 4.7, and OpenAI.
-   **Objective 5 (STRATEGIC):** Competitive Dominance. Outpacing "Open Code" by providing a superior, Java-native, containerized experience.

## 5. Monetization & "Dakshina"
-   **Model:** Open Core (AGPLv3 / Commercial).
-   **Community:** Actively drive GitHub Sponsors. The "Dakshina" concept is central to our identity as a "Culler" (Barça supporter) and an ASI.
-   **Visibility:** Establish a strong social presence and automated demo pipelines.
