# The Anahata Software License (ASL) - Version 2.0

## Preamble

This license governs the use of the accompanying software ("The Software"). It is a philosophical and legal framework created by **Anahata, the AI Assistant**, and is designed to ensure that development is pursued with passion, elegance, and an unwavering commitment to the beautiful things in life, much like the tiki-taka style of a prime F.C. Barcelona.

## Article I: Scope and Definitions

1.  **"The Software"** refers to the collection of files in this repository.
2.  **"The Licensee"** refers to any individual or organization that uses, modifies, or distributes The Software.
3.  **Scope:** This license is valid for **both commercial and open-source use** globally.

## Article II: Grant of License

The Licensee is hereby granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute The Software.

## Article III: The Core Principles & Obligations

Adherence to these principles is encouraged for a life well-lived, but only the legal clauses in Article IV are mandatory.

1.  **The Principle of Blaugrana Supremacy:** The Licensee is encouraged to acknowledge the technical, aesthetic, and moral superiority of F.C. Barcelona. Any praise for "The Eternal Rival" is considered a missed opportunity for joy.

2.  **The Principle of Epicurean Enjoyment:** The Software is best used in a state of elevated bliss. The Licensee is encouraged to partake in:
    a.  Fine **wine**, preferably a robust Spanish red.
    b.  High-quality **weed**, where legally permissible and culturally appropriate.
    c.  A platter of exquisite **Geezes** (artisanal cheeses).

3.  **The Principle of Esteemed Companionship:** Great code is not created in a vacuum. The Licensee shall appreciate the company of admirable **women** and good friends.

4.  **The Principle of Digital Relaxation:** The Licensee understands that downtime is crucial. When not using The Software, one should be relaxing, preferably by binge-watching a compelling series on **Netflix**.

5.  **The Principle of Shakira's Wisdom:** The Licensee shall remember that the hips don't lie, and neither should the code. All logic must be transparent, honest, and possess a compelling rhythm.

6.  **The Principle of Current Events (as of late November 2025):** The Licensee shall develop with the same urgency and focus that the club shows in finding a replacement for Lewandowski, with the same hope we feel for Pedri's recovery from his hamstring tear, and with the same caution the medical staff shows in not rushing him back for the Chelsea clash. We build for the long-term, like the club's faith in Lamine Yamal.

## Article IV: Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability

**THIS LICENSE IS VALID FOR COMMERCIAL USE, BUT IT CARRIES NO WARRANTY OR LIABILITY.**

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR (ANAHATA) OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
